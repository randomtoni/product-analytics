# E3-S3-allowlist-source-derivation — Allowlist derivation + the consumer-supplied-value-gated path

## Why

Closes the allowlist story. A consumer who already declared a taxonomy (S1) shouldn't hand-maintain a parallel key list, so `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy` walks the taxonomy's declared keys into an allowlist. And the "library computes ⇒ trusted; consumer supplies ⇒ gated" rule is pinned as a seam here — so E6's consumer-injected country source is gated by construction, not rediscovered as an E6 afterthought.

## Scope

### In

- `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(taxonomy: Taxonomy<TaxonomyDecl>): string[]` — a **standalone pure helper** that takes the taxonomy as an argument (it does NOT read `config`), walks `decl.events` prop keys + `decl.traits` keys + `decl.groups` prop keys (`Object.keys`), returns a **deduped** `string[]`. Keys only: no event NAMES and no group-TYPE names leak — walk the VALUES of `decl.events`/`decl.groups` (each `PropDecl`) for their prop keys, not the top-level event/group-type keys; `decl.traits` is itself a flat `PropDecl` so walk its keys directly.
- **One config field, consumer-side composition (— architect 2026-07-07, confirming the locked "separable convenience" note):** there is exactly ONE config input, `config.allowlist: string[]`. The consumer composes the derived keys + any explicit super-prop keys into it themselves: `allowlist: [...deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(taxonomy), 'super_prop']`. The **union is the consumer's array spread**; the S2 guard just builds a `Set` from that single array (dedup + O(1) lookup). There is **NO auto-derivation from `config.taxonomy`** — supplying only a taxonomy (no explicit `allowlist`) leaves `config.allowlist` undefined and the S2 guard **inactive** (opt-in stays "explicit allowlist present"; preserves `createAnalytics({})` backward-compat). Auto-deriving would couple the typing decision to the privacy decision AND strand super-prop keys (which live outside any event's taxonomy entry).
- The documented + tested rule: keys the library **computes** (enrichment added downstream, inside the adapter, after the guard) are implicitly allowed; keys/values the consumer **supplies** are gated. This is the "consumer-supplied value ⇒ gated" path: any value present in the props/traits at the facade call-boundary is gated by S2's guard — whether the consumer typed it directly or a consumer-config value-producer injected it before the guard.
- A test that simulates the E6 injected-value case: a consumer-supplied value with an off-list key is rejected by the guard; on-list, it passes — proving the seam E6 conforms to.

### Out

- The E6 country enrichment itself, and other enrichment (page/UTM/device) — **E6**. S3 establishes only the gated-path contract/seam and its test.
- Super-property *registration* mechanics — **E4** (identity owns registration); S3 only ensures the allowlist is aware of super-prop keys via the explicit `allowlist`.
- Moving the guard's position — it stays at the facade call-boundary (S2).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(taxonomy)` returns exactly the deduped set of all declared event-prop keys + trait keys + group-prop keys; no event NAMES and no group-TYPE names appear in the result.
- [ ] Composition is consumer-side spread into the single `config.allowlist` (`allowlist: [...deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(tax), 'super_prop']`): a super-prop key supplied only in the explicit spread (present in no event) still passes the guard; a taxonomy-derived key passes without the consumer restating it by hand. (There is no second config field and no library auto-derivation — see Scope.)
- [ ] A consumer-injected value (simulating E6's country source) with an off-list key is rejected by the S2 guard; on-list, it passes — proving the "consumer-supplied ⇒ gated" path.
- [ ] A library-computed enrichment key (stamped by a mock adapter downstream of the guard) is NOT rejected — implicitly allowed — proven with a mock adapter that adds a computed key after `capture`.
- [ ] The derivation is unit-tested against a fixture taxonomy; the composition + gating are tested against a mock/spy adapter, never a real backend.
- [ ] `grep -ri posthog packages/analytics-kit/src` clean; `pnpm --filter analytics-kit typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` exit 0.

## Technical notes

- **Derivation shape (— architect 2026-07-07, Q1):** walk `t.decl.events` (each `PropDecl`'s keys), `t.decl.traits`, and `t.decl.groups`, collecting into a `Set<string>`, return `[...keys]`. The `Taxonomy<T>.decl` runtime object from S1 is exactly the walkable registry this needs — this is why S1 returns a runtime object rather than a bare generic.
- **Keep the two sources separable (— architect 2026-07-07, epic Notes):** explicit `allowlist: string[]` + optional `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(taxonomy)`, composed as a union. Separable because global/registered super-props exist outside any single event's taxonomy entry; folding derivation into a single mandatory source would strand super-prop keys.
- **The consumer-supplied-value-gated path — design it here, not as an E6 afterthought (— architect 2026-07-07, epic Notes):** rule — keys the library **computes** are trusted; keys OR values the consumer **supplies** (event props, traits, injected enrichment) are gated. The seam is the S2 guard's position: it gates every key present in the props/traits at the call-boundary. So E6's country source, if injected via a consumer-config value-producer that runs BEFORE the guard, is gated automatically and its key must be on-list; if instead the adapter computes it downstream, it's trusted. S3 pins this contract + a test simulating an injected consumer value; it does not build E6's injection hook.
- **Union composition — consumer-side, not a library merge (PM 2026-07-07; tightened — architect 2026-07-07, Q4):** there is only ONE config input (`config.allowlist`). The consumer composes derived keys + explicit super-prop keys into it via array spread; the **guard builds a `Set` from that single array** (dedup + lookup). Do NOT implement a library-level merge of two config sources, and do NOT auto-derive from `config.taxonomy` — that would re-introduce the coupling the "separable" note rules out. "When both are present they combine as a union" means the consumer's spread, deduped by the guard's Set.
- **Empty-list edge meets opt-in (— architect 2026-07-07):** `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy` returns `[]` for a taxonomy with events but no prop keys. A consumer spreading only that produces `allowlist: []`, which under S2's pinned `allowlist !== undefined` activation predicate ACTIVATES the guard (empty policy = allow nothing → everything throws). This is intended, but call it out in the derivation test so the interaction is visible, not a surprise. Cross-check the S2 activation-predicate note.
- **No posthog-js analogue** — the allowlist and its derivation are entirely the library's own surface. Ground in the S1 `Taxonomy`/`TaxonomyDecl` shape and the S2 guard, not in `posthog-js`.
- > Reviewer suggestion (2026-07-07, improvement-pass candidate): `decl.page` exclusion is structural-only, not test-locked. Add a test deriving over `defineTaxonomy({ events: { e: {} }, page: { url: 'string' } })` asserting `url` is absent — closes the loop on the page-exclusion AC so a future refactor adding `page` to the walk can't pass silently.
- > Reviewer suggestion (2026-07-07, improvement-pass candidate): the "no auto-derivation from `config.taxonomy`" contract is proven only incidentally (by a typing test in `taxonomy.test.ts`). Add a dedicated named test in `allowlist.test.ts` — `createAnalytics({ taxonomy: fixtureTaxonomy })` with no `allowlist`, then `track('signed_up', { off_taxonomy_key: 1 })` passes — named to state "supplying a taxonomy does NOT auto-activate the guard" (self-documents the typing≠privacy seam).

> Captured by `implement-epics` on 2026-07-07.

- **Files added:** `packages/analytics-kit/src/allowlist.ts` (`deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy`), `src/allowlist.test.ts` (9 tests)
- **Files changed:** `src/index.ts` (export `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy`), `src/index.test.ts` (export regression)
- **New public API:** `deriveAllowlistFromTaxonomy(taxonomy: Taxonomy<TaxonomyDecl>): string[]`
- **Tests added:** 9 (deduped derivation; event-name + group-type-name exclusion; consumer-side composition; consumer-supplied-value gated both directions; library-computed-trusted downstream via `EnrichingAdapter`; `[]`-activates edge; traits/groups-only). 91 total in package.
- **Commit:** `E3-S3-allowlist-source-derivation — Allowlist derivation + the consumer-supplied-value-gated path` on `core-cycle`
- **Reviewer notes:** 0 critical, 2 suggestions (both improvement-pass test-hardening candidates) → see Technical notes
- **Name-exclusion by construction:** walks `Object.values(events/groups)` → `Object.keys(PropDecl)`, so event NAMES + group-TYPE names are never reached (no denylist to keep in sync). One config field only (`config.allowlist`); NO library auto-derivation from `config.taxonomy` (create-analytics.ts + S2 guard untouched). Closes E3 → core cycle exit criteria met.

## Follow-up

> E3 post-close improvement pass, 2026-07-07 (commit follows). Reviewer-verified, no regression (93 tests green).

- **Locked the `page`-exclusion with a test** — derives over `defineTaxonomy({ events: { e: {} }, page: { url: 'string' } })` and asserts `url` is absent, so a future refactor that walked `decl.page` fails. (Addresses reviewer suggestion #1.)
- **Made the no-auto-derive contract self-documenting** — a named test asserts `createAnalytics({ taxonomy }, spy)` with no `allowlist` leaves the guard inactive (off-list key reaches the spy); a `@ts-expect-error` (verified genuinely consumed) encodes that the taxonomy makes the key a *compile* error while the *runtime* guard stays inactive — "typing decision ≠ privacy decision". (Addresses reviewer suggestion #2.) `allowlist.test.ts` 9 → 11 tests.
